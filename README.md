# Optimized-LK-Flow
A trial to optimized LK-FLOW by Minimum mean square error filtering.

Besides, I try to achieve the "goodfeaturetracking" and "LK_FLOW" functions on my own out of opencv's encapsulation and the scripts are in the "Trial_LK_Flow" dictionary.

A test video offered in TestVideo fold.

Ongoing!
